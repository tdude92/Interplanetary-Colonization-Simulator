# Interplanetary-Colonization-Simulator
Elon Musk's dream.

This project was created for my ICS4U cellular automaton project, where we were allowed to simulate anything of our choosing.

The main idea behind this simulation is the trading of resources. The simulation was set up so that each "cell" of a planet would produce an insufficient amount of one specific resource while producing a surplus of another resource. Through these shortages, populated cells will be forced to share resources through an interplanetary "trading network".

The main file of the project is Interplanetary_Colonization.pde
